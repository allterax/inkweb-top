A1 Rules of Planning<br>
<br>
Today is March 3, 2025. I, Toby Coleman, am writing this plan in Bendigo. Last night, I took the right medicine, and then. When will it be implemented? Slang and popular language will not be used to spend a few minutes on it. It can be called the core of the content, if you want to talk about it, the core of the plan, let's talk about it in detail, although it is not a big deal. After a few minutes of dextromethorphan (a recreational drug), I had an epiphany that this realization is only in this world, despite the fact that I am in the real world, and I was reminded that this will be realized in the future. It will not be long after this. A few minutes, which is common for me. However, this was no ordinary experience, for before me stood a group of people whom I had never met and whom I would never have known before this experience. The experience seemed to last for years, even decades, but it lasted only a few minutes. Soon after, reality pulled me out of this sacred experience and I sat down with them. This was the reason why I had never seen this group of people standing before me, and this was not the ordinary experience I had planned, but it was. It’s unusual to say this, but I had an epiphany last night. I was planning to write this, and I’m here now, Manco Beato. The day is the month, and I’m ready to do it, right? Oh, right. Let’s start, how about this. So this is it, and it took a little while to pull me back, to remind me that I do exist in the real world. However, although this is only a brief experience in reality, it seems to last longer than the entire existence of human beings, at least that’s how it feels. Of course, even for an MIT graduate like me, it is almost impossible to express such feelings, so I won’t try. Instead, I will I will explain it to you in the form of a plan that I vaguely sketched out in my mind during the experiences I have described above. I consider this plan my "masterpiece", the best of all plans. If there is a "most important plan", it must be this one. In fact, I am willing to bet my life on the importance of this plan, because I plan to tell you about it soon, and I will be able to outline it in the form of a plan that I have vaguely sketched out in my mind during the experiences I have described. On the contrary, I have tried it, but it is not as if I can express it in this way. I don't think it will be like this after graduating from college in engineering. However, I feel that it is still there for a long time, but it is still a whole human being. I will put it into practice at some point in the near or distant future. Of course, I don't know the exact time yet. But I am sure that this plan will be realized at some point in my lifetime. That being said, let's talk about its details, the core of the plan, or you can call it its core content if you like. I can spend a few hours on the "plan" of the plan. (I know that I won't get it back for a long time because I am not planning for a long time. I will use my will to plan this life. I will bet on it. It is not that "the most important thing to plan" is true. There is a plan among the best, and I recognize that I am a "great" plan. Explain or add a glass of wine) I'm going to call myself "Mexico" and I'm going to plan this for the rest of my life using meaningless buzzwords and slang. What's the point of talking to you about a plan that tells you nothing? Nothing, period. With that said, let's get started. Oh, and be prepared, because this is a long one. So sit back, pour yourself a drink (or a snack), and enjoy this plan I call "The Mexican Plan." It's been only a few years, maybe even decades, and I've been going through this for years. We can't recognize that this experience is happening before, let's just say.<br>

A2 The Seminal Plans<br>
<br>
Of course, without a good start, the best of plans are useless. The best of choices are definitely good choices. Although we all hate slow starts, this is exactly where we have to start. Let’s be honest, there are always some slow starts in life, but you get through them in the end, so who can guarantee that our start this time will not be so easy? First of all, we are going to Europe, specifically France or Italy. I live in the absolute center of Victoria, Bendigo, so there are a lot of airports to choose from to say the least. After some in-depth research, I concluded that I would have a few good choices; they are Bendigo Airport (of course), Melbourne Airport, Essendon Airport, and a few other smaller airports that I really don’t want to include. Let’s start with Bendigo Airport, which is easy to tick right off the bat considering it is a regional airport, which makes it a disappointingly worthless airport, which is a shame considering its proximity to the surrounding areas. Next up is Melbourne Airport, which is the main airport for the city of the same name. This is a pretty good choice because it has the second highest air traffic volume in the country. Not only is this one of the best airports to fly into and out of Australia, but it is also one of the busiest airports. That being said, its website is also the main city name, and it's the next stop. It's a pity that it's so far away from the surrounding area, and the value of the venue is so great that it makes it easy to choose it immediately. So who can guarantee that there will be no opening this time? You will come here in the end, but there will always be some people who will open slowly, to be honest. We must start from this place, but we hate the slow opening. It's also a good plan. There is no opening, of course, it has to consider the local area, let's start with Godi. I don't think the airport is too small to be included in the list and the design is also the best of the three, of course, it seems that some people have considered it now, but it's just a small thing and it's not a good airport. Of course, the best of the three is also the design of the website, although this is true. The busiest airport is also the best airport in Australia. It's not just that the airport is the busiest, but the high volume of traffic in Australia has it as a reason for choosing it. This doesn't really say anything about an airport, and it's a minor thing, but considering how much some people seem to care about website design these days, I'd recommend it. My god, look at my website, do you think I care? Having said that, it is important to determine from which ticket is average, higher or even lower priced. The first thing to consider when choosing an airport to depart from is that we need to know where we want to fly to, so we should figure that out first. According to Google data, airfare to France is generally cheaper no matter which city you're flying from. Choosing one thing only achieves success, but that is not all. Even some of these flights don't have cheap tickets to Paris, Toulouse and Lyon. Next we need to fly to Australia, according to Google. So first we need to know where we want to fly to, so we need to know exactly which airport we want to fly from, but how about that? I guess you can tell me which day it is. I'm wondering why you suggest this. The purpose of setting up the station network is to determine which city you are flying to, but this should be easy to determine. Google shows that the cheapest cities are Paris, Nice, Toulouse and Lyon. Also, during my research I discovered that Essendon Airport no longer offers international flights, so we can cross it off the list, leaving Melbourne Airport alone. This shouldn't be easy to cross off, so we need to figure out which city to fly to next. But this is not all, and the law of the country is more common in airports, and the price of tickets is no longer required, according to another study conducted in our country. The most affordable cities are Heli, Slovenia, Lebanon and Zloty, according to the research. So that makes it the only choice. Anyway, back to deciding which city to fly to. Flights to Paris usually cost around $1900 to $2100 on average, so this can be a pretty expensive choice, but we've come to the conclusion that the choice is quite limited, so we've got to think of Gordie - the absolute best choice in mind. Italy or France are particularly special, so if you want to go to Europe, what are the more expensive options first? Nice fares are even higher, with an average of $2200. Lyon and Toulouse are also worth considering. Italy is still under consideration, but it's not all cheap, of course, with some flights averaging around $200 to Paris. Work can even be up to $2500. The choice is clear, Paris is the best choice. Of course, that's not all, we now have to consider Italy.<br>

A3 Italian Family and Country<br>
<br>
Italy. What comes to mind when you hear the word "Italy"? Most likely you think of pizza, pasta, and the like. But when I think of Italy, I think "cheap." Because I'm considering flights from Australia to France for the first time, I'm going to split the plan into four parts. There is no need to plan too much, and the choice is indeed very clear, although this is the case. Isn't it strange that, unlike the nearby Italy and France, flights from France to Italy are shockingly cheap, averaging only $90 to $130, and the return trip has once been a big deal. We will go to Gome and Feili, and start the third chapter of "Division Two". The scene is divided into two parts, one is the curtain, and the other is the perfect scene for many people who have lost their hope. This doesn't seem like much of a stretch to me, and it's a far cry from the thousands of dollars that previous flights would have cost, but it's not surprising given how close France and Italy are. That being said, the choice is clear, and there's not a lot of planning required here. Now, I was going to split the rest of the plan into parts, but you get what you sow. Now, I was going to split the following planning section into the first part, but I’m not going to go far enough. I’m not going to spend more than AUD 3,300 on this flight, but given the length of this scene so far, I’m not going to go wrong, and I’m going to spend about AUD 1,000 on this flight. This is less than the number of flights to and from the United States on comparable flights, so Yibian thinks this is not very reasonable. So, to the disappointment of many completists, this scene will be more of a two-part scene. Starting with “Part 2” of Act 3, we will fly from Italy to the United States. Now, as a person who used to travel between Australia and the United States, I was scared of the convenience flights from France to Australia, because there were different flights from France to Australia. "Convenient" may make me think of it, but I think of it at the same time. Can you think of it in the same way as in the face of Italy, Sapi, etc.? What does this word "convenience" mean to you? As someone who has been to Italy (Boston to be specific), I can assure you that flights to and from these two countries are not cheap. Thankfully, not only did we fly from Italy, but flights from Italy to the US are much cheaper than Australia and budget is not an issue here at all, so no worries dear reader. Because we were going to pick up Corey (who I will elaborate on later in this article), we needed to fly to Florida, so we had to make the cut. We cannot but reap a harvest, as we have already sown too many seeds. The flight from Italy to Florida was pretty cheap, at least compared to the flight from Dariloff to Italy. We'll need to pay around $800 to $1,000, which may sound good at first, but then you'll find out that we're not taking just one person on this flight, but three, which means we're not the only one on this flight, and that's not the problem here. Australia is a much cheaper airline than the United States, and we are not the only one to fly to Australia, thank goodness. You can tell me it’s impossible to fly these two countries back and forth without spending enough money, and it would cost more than 3,000 Australian dollars to go to Florida (America and Australia). But you reap what you sow, and we have sown too many seeds that we cannot help but reap. So, don’t delay any longer! Let’s move on to Act Four!<br>
<br>
A4 Mexico, oh my god<br>
<br>
Now, you. Despite the disappointment, we decided to go to Alonso, and you might be wondering, why did you start talking about Mexico? Well, by the time you realize Florida, we're going to New Mexico. New Mexico is basically Mexico, but it's just the same. Let's drive again and consider flying there. The destination of New Mexico, as we've chosen to do, is New Mexico, but it's not the same as Cozumel, right? Well, maybe not. But you have to admit that they are at least a little bit similar in name. All joking aside, we need to figure out whether it's more economical to fly or drive from Florida to New Mexico. Considering there's more than one of us, we need to figure this out. What do we do now? Although it is obvious that the choice is easy to make, it is like driving a car. There are not just four of us living on our feet, but we're almost halfway through a station. It's going to cost you thousands of dollars to fly to Highland, but I think you have to consider that there are many more American passengers, so it's crucial to understand this. A quick Google search shows that flying is usually cheaper in this situation, so the choice is obvious: fly. Believe it or not, you can fly from Florida to New Mexico for $13.99. Using the U.S. government's fuel economy calculator, and quickly selecting a 2025 Volkswagen Atlas as our first choice, we can easily expect to pay about $250, or about $400 Australian dollars, before meals and other expenses. Sure, you could say it’s cheaper to fly, but your argument almost immediately falls apart when you realize that flights can cost thousands of dollars considering we have multiple passengers. That being said, driving is the obvious choice, so that's what we'll do. Next, we have to figure out Mexico. Yes, it's Mexico, not New Mexico. I'll be there tomorrow, brother Daryl, when we get to New Mexico we'll need you to wait, ok? I'm going to Mexico, and I'm going to Mexico now. For reasons I can't explain or remember, we will choose Pachuca or Sinaloa as our destination. Given the cost of flying, we will again choose to drive. Using the same calculation as the US government, many wealthy people choose to add speed and cost-effective fuel. Using the same economical fuel calculator as the choice, we estimate that we will pay about $130 USD or $200 AUD for fuel to drive to Sinaloa and $200 USD or $320 AUD for fuel to drive to Pachuca. So the choice was obvious and we decided to go to Sinaloa, even though it was overpriced to fly from Costa Rica to Dar es Sinaloa, believe it or not. Flying: Obviously, this choice is more convenient, which may make flying more common, but in this case, we need to figure out how to get to Dar es Sinaloa from Costa Rica, but we are just kidding. It looks a bit similar, but there are few words on it, yet you can recognize it. You are not allowed to do that, okay? Right, it's not just about the new Mexico, it's about the next Mexico search Google will be fast. It's important to focus on this point, and we need to understand more and more about the United States. And there are four people, but there is only one person who doesn't need to consider it. The economic situation is even more disappointing when driving a car or flying on a plane.<br>
<br>
A5 The outline<br>
<br>
If you read. Let's take a break and rest for a while. We are exhausted. We'll be in Alonso with Rico and Nezhima by now, and we'll be ready to go on to Alonso for five days. In order to prepare for the journey ahead, we will meet at home overnight, and there will be time for consideration. It's up to you to believe it or not. Is that the point? I mean, it's a plan, not a damn menu!" Dear readers, I would like to say that we arrived in Balada at about noon, a journey that lasted all day and all night, and that the long journey began. The journey to Mexico is well underway, and you will soon find out, because now I will really start to elaborate on the "plan" itself, not just the prices and so on. On the first day, I will leave for the airport early, which is usually a good habit. Once we arrived in France, it was still early in the morning (jet lag, huh?), so there was plenty of time to rest up in the hotel, grab a quick bite to eat, and then head out to pick up Matthew. Prepare to go to Rico and Nizhima, Tema, and I on Day 3. The rest time is enough for the next day, and the hotel reservations will take about an hour to drive from Paris to Matthew's house, so if there is enough travel and rest time, I should arrive around 3 pm. We should arrive at the airport around 5pm to fly to Italy and arrive in Rome around 7pm. After arriving in Rome, we will pick up Mazzini, have dinner and book a hotel for the night before noon. Then the car will start driving and Rico will pick us up after lunch. We should arrive in Patanda at around 10:00 p.m. and arrive in Suyin District at that time. After boarding the flight, we headed to the airport and had a quick breakfast. We will be ready to fly to Daliro the next morning. After booking a hotel room and having dinner, Nizhi will pick us up immediately, and we will arrive at Maro the next morning. The next morning, we will arrive at Maroda at around 7pm, ready to fly to Lisbon, and arrive at around 11pm. I should arrive at about 8pm in the afternoon. If you have enough time to rest and travel, you will know soon. "My dear reader, tell me you miss me!" The death of the single dish is not this, is this the plan, is this what I mean? But what can he really say when he gets to the point? I love to talk about driving and flying. I really love it, my friends. Which day can I stay here? If you read this, I need to make an appointment with everyone to get ready to fly to Florida. After a quick breakfast, we will head to the airport and catch our flight. Taking into account the time zone, we should arrive in Tampa around 12pm. We will pick up Corey, have lunch, and then start driving. Before midnight, we will book a hotel to get fully rested for the remaining 16 hours of driving the next day. On the third day, I will drive from Lebanon. After being picked up by Xiuma, we will have a quick meal at the bar (it’s still early) and rest in the hotel. There is enough time for us to arrive at the airport later. This is a good habit. I will go to the airport a little early, Day one. It's not just the price of the class that's really starting to unfold, and that's why Matt, Mazzini, and Corey are all ready for their journey to New Mexico. We boarded the Atlas and began the long journey, traveling day and night until we arrived in Albuquerque around midnight. Given the time, we will stay overnight at Alan's house to prepare for the journey to Mexico. On the fourth day, the five of us prepared to head to Mexico. Believe it or not, the trip to Sinaloa is pretty long, so we spent almost the entire day driving. Day five and the last day. Me, Matt, Mazzini, Corey, and Alan Morford arrived in Sinaloa. We were exhausted, so we took a day off, relaxed, and rested for a while.<br>
<br>
A6 The ultimate behind the scenes<br>
<br>
Once we get to Sinaloa, we can start our harem. We can buy a cheap property for around 4.5 million Mexican pesos (about 352,528 Australian dollars). After getting the property, we can start the "harem". At this point, you might be thinking, "Hey, isn't Cory a minor? I know this is Mexico, but this is not a third world country, they have a legal age too!" To which I would say, you're right. Sure, it may be a little illegal, but the legal age in Sinaloa is 12, so that's totally legal. It's a state with age-based laws, so it's totally legal here. And, no harm, no foul. In other words, Cory can do whatever he wants, and that's it. No matter if there are any violations or no injuries, you can have fun without worrying about the dictator's dictating what to do, ...<br>
<br>
A7 Conclusion<br>
<br>
Yes, the end note is very 20th century style. But hey, who cares? Free speech is gone. I hope you can think of some of these things and thank you for reading my plan. Is that right? I think so. I just write some nonsense about the tragic events of my life, even if it doesn't exist in Australia strictly speaking. Yeah, I really can't think of anything that won't happen to me, and I really don't want to write anything good, yeah. Isn't it so easy to write about it now? Besides, I am not as good as other great writers. Even if I say it strictly, what is the reason for my own comments? Who cares, hey, but. The ending of the chronicle is very explanatory, just some random nonsense like my tragic life story. So, all I want to say is, thank you for reading my plan and I hope it gave you some food for thought. Goodbye!
